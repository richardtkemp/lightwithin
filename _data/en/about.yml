  Hi, I’m Eleni Vantana, founder of The Light From Within, and I believe your journey to true wellness begins when you quiet the chaos of diet culture and rediscover your body’s natural wisdom. My mission? To guide you toward a joyful, nourishing relationship with food—one built on self-compassion, trust, and freedom, not rules or restrictions.
 
  For years, I’ve helped people break free from the exhausting cycle of diets, guilt, and shame. Here’s what I know: You don’t need another meal plan or calorie-counting app. What you do need is a safe space to reconnect with your intuition, honor your hunger, and savor food without judgment. That’s why I created The Light From Within—a sanctuary where healing begins by listening to you.

  My approach blends intuitive eating principles with mindful, evidence-based strategies. Together, we’ll gently unpack harmful beliefs, celebrate progress over perfection, and explore what it means to nourish your body and soul. Whether you’re healing from years of dieting, seeking body acceptance, or simply craving peace at the dinner table, I’ll walk beside you with tools, empathy, and unwavering support.

  This isn’t just about food—it’s about reclaiming your power. Here, you’ll find a compassionate community, practical guidance, and the freedom to embrace your unique journey. No rigid programs. No judgment. Just you, learning to trust yourself again.

  I’ve seen firsthand how lighting that spark within can transform lives. Let me help you shine.

  Ready to step into a life where food feels like freedom, not fear? Let’s begin.

  _Your light is already there. Let’s uncover it together._
